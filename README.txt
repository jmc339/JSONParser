This is the README File for the json parser assignment

This is fairly simple, to use the program open and run main.cpp and make sure that the file from the repository
"json.txt" is in the same directory or folder, as the program.
You may use any other file with json data just make sure to use option 1
when the program is at the main menu. (The main menu is just the output when the program asks for the user to type 1 or 2)

The program runs on ubuntu using Code::Blocks and the terminal using g++ so long as the correct flags are used (The newest ones)
The program also runs on windows and Mac computers.

 ****More information can be found in main.cpp by looking at the head comment and
 ****Any in-line comment.
 **** Contact information is given in the header comment.
